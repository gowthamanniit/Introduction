	in 1980's first introduced by bjarne strostrup.

	c++ is a oops langauge.

	oops: object oriented programming structure.

	c++ is a compiler(whole program error check).

	c++ is a case sensitive langauge.

	c++ extension: .cpp

	c++ bottom to top approach.

	c++ variable declaration anywhere (before statement).

                  c++ starting name c with class.
	
	oops:

		class
		object
		abstraction
		encapsulation
		constructor
		destructor
		polymorphism
		access specifier
		inheritance
		friend function
		virtural function
		scope resoultion operator
		operator overloading
		static variable , function , class.
	
	
	class:
		
		class is a hierarchy.
		class is a user defined data type. it is used to
		access member variable and member function.

	syntax:

		class classname
		{
			access specifier:		
			member variable;
			member function;
		};			


	access specifier:
	==============
		1. private : the members only use with in class.
		2. public  : any where
		3. protected: base class and derive class.


	ex:

		class student
		{
			private:
			int a,b;
			public:
			void functionname()
			{
			 // body of the function			
			}
		};
		
	object:
		instance of the class.

	ex:
		void main()
		{
			classname objectname;
			// accessing class member
			objectname.varaiable;
			objectname.functionname();

		}
