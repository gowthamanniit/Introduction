python extension: .py


support some recent technology:

1.cloud computing---iaas,paas,
2.networking
3.big data
4.hacking tools


use:
1.web development
2.software development
3.GUI--graphical user interface
4.Games development
5.Many app


Advantage:
1.python as simple syntax
2.allow the developer to code with in a few lines
3.python run as interpreter
4.python is an object oriented language---
5.debug faster
6.python works on different platforms

important features in python:

1.high level prg lanuage
2.simple
3.open source
4.GUI
5.Large standard library
6.object-oriented
7.interpreter
8.platform independent


errors:
1.name error
2.indent error
3.type error
4.syntax error
5.value error
6.zerodivision error

int a=10;
int b=20:

python------define
a=10
b=20
char--collection of char is a string,,





Basic Building blocks:


1.identifier:
name given given to var, fun,  class

eg:salary=20,000
a=20,000

2.variables:
x=5
y="john"
print(x)
print(y)

3.numeric values:
int, float, str,char

a=10

b=1.1

c="welcome"

d="s"

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
......

operators:

1.Arc opr
Add,sub,div,mul,,modules,,floor div, exponential

x=5
y=3
print(x+y) or z=x+y print(z)


sub:

x=5
y=3
print(x-y)
2


mul:

3*2
4*3


div:

4/2
5/3
5/2

mod:

x=45
y=5
x%y


floor div:
5//2==2.5

expo:

x=10
y=20

x**y






2.Rel opr:
==     x=10
y=20

x==y

!=------x=10, y=10


>,>=

x=2
y=4
x>y--true

<,<=

3.log ope--

And---

1  0   1  0
0  1   1  1
0  0   1  0







Or---

1  0  0  1

0  1  0  1
1  1  0  1

4.Bitwise

Bitwise and

Bitwise or




5.special opr
  (i)-identity oper
      used to find value is similar or not
     
 is
is not






  (ii)-membership operator

  used to find whether value is valid or not

in
not in




Control statements:

decision making sta...

1.simple if
2.if-else
3.nested -if
4.elif statement


simple if:

if cond true it will print the statement

if-else:

if the cond is true it will print valid user or else it will print invalid user


nested if:
if


   if ()
      pr

pr



elif:


short for if-else
it allow to check the multiple expression


conditional loop statement:
while loop:

break:

continue:

for loop

do-while:

nested -loop:





while loop:
execute statement untill condition is true:


break and continue:
